# Rebase

!!!REBASE IS NOT DONE YET, DONT REPORT BUGS THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DONE!!!

Rebase is a cli-app for fedora and other rhel-based distributions. It's made to make fedora and similar distros more reproducible. 

## Features
- Easy configuration
- Lightweight


## How does it work?
Rebase gets all installed packages, stores this information and re-installs them on your new installation. (also works with flatpak)
For configuration files. You can add file paths and the file gets replaced with a symlink. While the actual file gets moved to 1 directory rebase can read.
